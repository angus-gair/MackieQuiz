If the text is **still not displaying**, we need to **debug potential causes**. Here are the most likely reasons and solutions:

---

## **1️⃣ Verify That `showTeams` Is Updating Correctly**
If `showTeams` is not properly toggling, the description will not change.

### **🔍 Debugging Step**
Add a console log inside your `useState` update function:

```tsx
<Button
  variant={!showTeams ? "default" : "ghost"}
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => {
    setShowTeams(false);
    console.log("Switched to Individual Rankings. showTeams:", showTeams);
  }}
>
  <User className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Individual</span>
</Button>
```
```tsx
<Button
  variant={showTeams ? "default" : "ghost"}
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => {
    setShowTeams(true);
    console.log("Switched to Team Rankings. showTeams:", showTeams);
  }}
>
  <Users className="h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Team</span>
</Button>
```
🚀 **Expected Output in Browser Console:**  
- Clicking **Individual** should log:  
  `"Switched to Individual Rankings. showTeams: false"`
- Clicking **Team** should log:  
  `"Switched to Team Rankings. showTeams: true"`

✅ If the console logs **are correct**, move to step **2**.  
❌ If the state is not updating, try this fix:  
```tsx
onClick={() => setShowTeams(prev => !prev)}
```

## **2️⃣ Check If Tailwind's `text-muted-foreground` Class Is Hiding the Text**
If `text-muted-foreground` is applying `opacity-0` or `text-transparent`, your text **exists but is invisible**.

### **🔍 Debugging Step**
1️⃣ **Temporarily remove the class and hardcode text color:**
```tsx
<div className="text-sm text-center mb-6 text-red-500">
  {showTeams ? (
    <p>Teams are ranked by weekly quiz completion rate</p>
  ) : (
    <p>Individuals are ranked by total points accumulated over multiple weeks through quiz completions</p>
  )}
</div>
```
🚀 **If text appears, Tailwind was hiding it**.  
✅ Solution: Adjust your Tailwind class, maybe using `text-primary`.

## **3️⃣ Ensure Component Is Re-Rendering When `showTeams` Changes**
If React is **not re-rendering** when `showTeams` updates, you might need to force an update.

### **🔍 Debugging Step**
1️⃣ **Add a unique `key` to force re-renders:**
```tsx
<div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground text-center mb-6" key={showTeams ? "teams" : "individual"}>
  {showTeams ? (
    <p>Teams are ranked by weekly quiz completion rate</p>
  ) : (
    <p>Individuals are ranked by total points accumulated over multiple weeks through quiz completions</p>
  )}
</div>
```
🚀 **If this works, React was not detecting the state change**.

## **4️⃣ Check If `useIsMobile` Is Causing Conflicts**
The `useIsMobile()` hook **might be overriding styles or conditionally hiding elements**.

### **🔍 Debugging Step**
1️⃣ **Temporarily remove `useIsMobile` from the component**:
```tsx
const isMobile = false; // Force non-mobile mode
```
2️⃣ **Test the toggle again**.

🚀 **If text appears, `useIsMobile` was interfering.**  
✅ Solution: Modify mobile-specific styles.

---

## **Final Step: Console Log The Description Directly**
If nothing works, **log the description before rendering**:
```tsx
console.log("Current Description:", showTeams ? "Teams are ranked by weekly quiz completion rate" : "Individuals are ranked by total points accumulated over multiple weeks through quiz completions");
```
🚀 **If the log is correct, the issue is CSS or Tailwind-related.**  
🚨 **If the log does NOT update, `showTeams` is not changing**.

---

### **🎯 Summary**
✔ **Step 1:** Check if `showTeams` is updating using `console.log`.  
✔ **Step 2:** Remove `text-muted-foreground` and force text color (`text-red-500`).  
✔ **Step 3:** Force re-render by adding a `key`.  
✔ **Step 4:** Disable `useIsMobile()` and test behavior.  
✔ **Step 5:** Log the actual description **before rendering**.
