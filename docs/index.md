## Using This Documentation

This documentation is designed to be a comprehensive reference for developers working on the Business Knowledge Enhancement Platform. Here's how to make the most of it:

1. **New Developers**: Start with the [Main Overview](./README.md) to understand the purpose and architecture of the application.

2. **Frontend Developers**: Focus on the [Frontend](./frontend/README.md) section, which details components, state management, and UI patterns.

3. **Backend Developers**: Refer to the [Backend](./backend/README.md) section for API routes, middleware, and server configuration.

4. **Database Work**: The [Database](./database/README.md) section provides schema details and data access patterns.

5. **Testing**: Use the [Testing](./testing/README.md) guide for implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

6. **Code Structure**: The [Application Structure](./architecture/application-structure.md) provides visual diagrams of the codebase.

## Updating Documentation

When making significant changes to the application, please update the relevant documentation:

1. **New Features**: Add documentation for new features in the appropriate section.
2. **API Changes**: Update the Backend documentation when changing API endpoints.
3. **Schema Changes**: Update the Database documentation when modifying the database schema.
4. **UI Components**: Document new or modified components in the Frontend section.

## Automated Testing

This documentation serves as the foundation for implementing automated testing. The [Testing](./testing/README.md) section provides guidelines for:

1. Writing unit tests for components and functions
2. Implementing integration tests for API endpoints
3. Creating end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Setting up continuous integration pipelines

## Diagrams and Visualizations

The documentation includes several diagrams to visualize the application structure:

- Component hierarchy
- Data flow
- API communication patterns
- Database schema relationships

These visualizations help understand the relationships between different parts of the application and aid in debugging and development.
